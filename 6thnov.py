#unit 5 classes object oriented programming python c++ java
#procedural object-based object oriented
#procedural programming based on function the main focus is on function rather than data
#object oriented programming supports (classes: it is a way to bind the data)class comprises of data and
#classes and object
#encapsulation
#abstaction
#polymorphism
#inheritance
#data function
#classes and object
#encapsulation:data and its related function at one place
#abstraction hiding the detailed information from the user.
# its related functions (data is the attributes )
#object based programming does not support inheritance(inherit the properties) as well as polymorphism(many segments)(same nature in different way)(same thing behave different at different place)
#classes :1. data : data member 2. functions:member functions
#object is nothing but instace of class
